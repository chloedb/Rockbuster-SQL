# Rockbuster-SQL

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. 

## Key Questions and Objectives

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Project Documentation
The initial project brief offered to me at the beginning of the project timeline. The brief offers the questions and objectives of the project for Rockbuster Stealth.

## Data
The dataset is one file accessible within a SQL database referenced within the datasets folder.

## Project Deliverables
Ultimately, I delivered a revenue analysis of their customers and how revenue will impact the strategy rollout of a new streaming product.

There are four separate project deliverables:
1. Data dictionary of the dataset to provide all keys and types
2. SQL queries and their given outputs divided by excel page
3. Data visualizations of exported SQL queries into Tableau
4. PowerPoint presentation of all information, data, and analysis including objectives, data visualizations, and recommendations.
